	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>		I want to become a software developer because I am deeply passionate about technology and how it transforms the world around us. From a young age, I have been curious about how websites, mobile applications, and software systems work behind the scenes. Becoming a developer allows me to solve real-world problems using logic, creativity, and innovation. I enjoy writing code, debugging errors, and continuously improving my problem-solving skills. Software development also provides endless learning opportunities, as technology evolves every day and challenges me to grow professionally. I want to build applications that are efficient, scalable, and helpful to people in their daily lives. Being a developer gives me the power to turn ideas into reality and contribute to meaningful digital solutions that can impact society in a positive way.
